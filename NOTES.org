* NOTES
- have notes stored both in database and in text file
- anything else is way to fucking hard
- test on making input field bigger when both editing and creating pages
- "<textarea rows="5" cols="80" id="TITLE"></textarea>"


- add buttons to delete or edit page from wiki home
- button to create page would just link back to the new-page.php

- edit page would be like the create page except with the current title and contents from database echoed into the input fields.


-some type of javascript to render org or markdown for contents.
