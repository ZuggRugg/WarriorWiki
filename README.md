# WarriorWiki

This is a Wiki application for my CS 234 Database class that I am building using PHP and MySQL


Articles for my Wiki will be stored inside a MySQL database and the website will feature user registration and sign up requirements as well


The intended use for this application is to try and replicate some of the features that MediaWiki has implemented with Wikipedia but more tailored for private usage and note-taking.



## How to Install

We are using the MAMP or LAMP stack for class and the easiest way to run this application is to copy the repository into your htdocs directory and run the main-page.php file from there.
